            I hope to learn more about best practices of web development. I would love to understand more about React
            and how it differes from front end frameworks that I'm already familair with. To laugh with my friends and cry with my friends
            as Intex slowly crushes us from without. That we might laugh in the face of our grades and not care. That I might sing praises of
            glory that is IS 413. How long does this paragraph need to be?
